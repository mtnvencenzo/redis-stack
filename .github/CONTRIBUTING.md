## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧰 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Git
- Basic understanding of Redis
- Familiarity with containerization concepts

### 🗂️ Project Structure

```
├── docker-compose.yml          # Main Docker Compose configuration
├── .github/                   # GitHub workflows and templates
└── README.md                  # Project overview and setup guide
```

## 💻 Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mtnvencenzo/redis-stack.git
   cd redis-stack
   ```

2. **Test the Current Setup**
   ```bash
   # Start the Redis services
   docker compose up -d
   
   # Check service health
   docker compose ps
   
   # View logs
   docker compose logs
   
   # Stop the services
   docker compose down -v
   ```

3. **Validate Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Validate Docker Compose syntax
   docker compose config
   
   # Check Redis server
   docker exec redis redis-cli ping
   
   # Check RedisInsight UI
   curl -f http://localhost:5540
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our [configuration standards](#-configuration-standards)

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Validate Docker Compose
   docker compose config
   
   # Test the services
   docker compose up -d
   
   # Check services are healthy
   docker exec redis redis-cli ping
   curl -f http://localhost:5540
   
   # Test Redis operations
   docker exec redis redis-cli SET test-key "test-value"
   docker exec redis redis-cli GET test-key
   
   # Clean up test
   docker compose down -v
   ```

4. **Update documentation**
   - README.md with any new features or changes
   - Configuration comments for complex settings
   - Asset diagrams if architecture changes

## 📏 Configuration Standards

### 📊 Redis Best Practices

- **Service Discovery**: Use proper service names and networking
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate memory and CPU limits for containers
- **Health Checks**: Include health checks for all services
- **Security**: Follow Docker security best practices
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments in configuration files

### 🧪 Code Quality

```bash
# Validate Docker Compose
docker compose config

# Test service startup
docker compose up -d --wait

# Check service health
docker compose ps

# View service logs
docker compose logs
```
